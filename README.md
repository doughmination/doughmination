Hey there, I'm Doughmination!

I am a programmer fluent in various languages, including TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Python and various shell languages like Bash and PowerShell,

I am a 21 year old transfemme with 8 years in experience coding, self taught starting in JavaScript Discord bots.

I've since specialized in DevOps, CyberSec Web Dev and Shell Code. I also work with many OS's and know variating fixes for issues from simple usbs not registering, problematic drivers, partitioning, to malware recovery and DevOps.

I work only on AMD specific issues, and not NVIDEA or Intel

I freelance my works of Web Development, OS repairs (mostly Windows and Debian related issues), and run a malware recovery service.
